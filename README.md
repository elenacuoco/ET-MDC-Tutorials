# Einstein Telescope Mock Data Challenge Analysis

## Overview

This repository contains notebook  and scripts for analyzing the Mock Data Challenge 1 for the Einstein Telescope. The Einstein Telescope is a proposed third-generation gravitational-wave observatory that aims to significantly advance our understanding of 
the universe through the observation of gravitational waves.

The Mock Data Challenge involves simulating gravitational-wave signals and testing the capability of data analysis algorithms to detect and characterize these signals in the presence of noise.

## Contents
